# MyBar
This project represents a bar.

The app is hosted at: https://intense-stream-75057.herokuapp.com/

It uses the in-memory database H2 and is implemented using Spring Data Rest: https://projects.spring.io/spring-data-rest/

Various items can be added to the bar.

At startup the application adds the following items: Whisky, Ice, Beer, Vodka, Sprite, Ice.

Further new items and products can be added.

A product is nothing but an entry on the menu in the bar.

Every product must have exactly one primary item and can have zero or more add on items.
